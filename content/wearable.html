            <h3>Wearable tech for the visually impaired</h3>
            <p>
                Researchers have created a wearable computer to aid the blind, and help reduce collision risk.
                <br/>
                The computer consists of a small mainboard and several cameras which allow it to detect objects around the wearer, 
                when used in conjunction with a guide dog, it is reportedly 40% effective at preventing collisions 
                (<a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2021/07/22/blindness-wearable-device-accidents-study/8601626962178/?spt=su&or=btn_tw">source</a>)
                <br/>
                This device can also be beneficial to those who cannot afford the expense of a guide dog, which can cost up to $60,000
                Upon detection of a collision hazard, one of the two bluetooth enabled wristbands that the user wears will vibrate, indicating which direction the object is in

            <h3>Wearable tech for health monitoring</h3>
            <p>
                Many people now own a smart watch, the capabilities of which are ever expanding.
                Most modern smart watches have the capability to track heart rate, and some have more advanced features, such as SpO2 monitoring
                <br/>
                Even outside of professional healthcare scenarios, this functionality can encourage users to lead a more healthy lifestyle.
                <br/>
                The primary concerns of the use of consumer wearables in a professional setting are the high risk of false positives being thrown due to improper use, and the fact that a user must actively engage for the device to be effective.
                <br/>
                Providing a statement of "you have high blood pressure" is of little benefit if the user will not adapt their lifestyle to ammend it.
